# Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to my repository for exploring algorithms and data structures! This repository is a collection of implementations and solutions crafted during a three-module course, showcasing a wide range of topics from foundational bitwise operations to complex graph algorithms.

## üìö Course Modules Overview

### **Module 1: Foundational Data Structures and Searching Techniques**
In the first module, the focus was on mastering the basics of data structures and search algorithms. Key accomplishments include:
- **Bitwise Operations**
- **Binary and Exponential Search**: Efficient searching algorithms implemented in C++.
- **Data Structures**: 
  - Stack
  - Queue (using two stacks)
  - Binary Heap
  - Merge Sort
- **Object-Oriented Implementation**: All structures and algorithms were implemented using **classes** and **structures** in C++ for clean and reusable code design.

### **Module 2: Advanced Data Structures**
The second module introduced more sophisticated data structures and algorithms, emphasizing memory management and optimization. Highlights include:
- **String Set**: A custom data structure resembling a **set of strings**, built using a **dynamic hash table** with open addressing for collision handling.
- **Trees**:
  - **Binary Search Tree** (BST)
  - **B-Tree**: A self-balancing tree ideal for database systems.
  - **AVL Tree**: A height-balanced binary search tree for faster lookup, insert, and delete operations.
- **Huffman Encoding**:
  - Implementation of the **Huffman Compression Algorithm**, optimized for streaming data.
  - The algorithm compresses input streams and returns the result as a stream, ensuring efficiency for real-time applications.

### **Module 3: Graph Theory and Complex Algorithms**
The final module explored graph theory and its practical applications, culminating in a project solving the sliding puzzle ("15-puzzle"). Key topics include:
- **Graph Representations**: Adjacency lists, matrices, and edge lists.
- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.
- **Sliding Puzzle Solver**: An algorithm designed to solve the **15-puzzle** game using graph traversal and heuristic optimizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Concepts Applied**: Object-oriented programming, dynamic memory management, and algorithmic optimization.
